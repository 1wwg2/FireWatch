Assess the situation and use the rescue kit: Before you begin providing
assistance, make sure that the scene is safe for you and the victim.
If you have a special rescue kit, check its contents and prepare the necessary tools and materials.
Make sure that you have communication equipment to call for help if needed.

Check the victim's condition: Assess consciousness, breathing,
and pulse. If the victim is not breathing or has no pulse,
begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Contact emergency services: Use communication equipment to call
for an ambulance if necessary. Provide the exact location
and details of the incident.

First aid:
Bleeding: Use sterile dressings from your kit and apply pressure to stop bleeding.

Fractures and dislocations: Immobilize the injured limb with splints and bandages
from the kit to prevent further damage.

Bruises and sprains: Apply a cold compress from the kit to the injured area
to reduce swelling.

Poisoning: If the victim has been poisoned, try to find out what exactly caused the poisoning
and follow the first aid instructions in your kit.

Support the victim: Try to calm the victim using the supplies in the kit if available,
and keep them comfortable. If the victim is in shock, lay them on their back,
elevate their legs, and cover them with a blanket to keep them warm.

Prepare the victim for transport: Use the supplies in the rescue kit
to move the victim safely if necessary.
Support any injured parts of the body and minimize movement.

Monitor the victim: Monitor the victim's condition constantly and report any changes
to medical personnel upon arrival.
